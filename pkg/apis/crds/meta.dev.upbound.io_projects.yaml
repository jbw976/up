              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

                    Dependency is a dependency on another package. A dependency can be of an
                    arbitrary API version and kind, but Crossplane expects package dependencies
                    to behave like a Crossplane package. Specifically it expects to be able to
                    create the dependency and set its spec.package field to a package OCI
                    reference.
